    sentences:
    - Well howdy there partner! Pleasure ta make your acquaintance!
    - To be honest, it's a bit tough finding people who are interested in farming
      these day.
    - Not entirely sure why, it's good, honest, rewardin' work!
    - And you're showing up just in time. Weird naked aliens have started attacking
      our ranch!
    - We could use all the help we can get. I'll show you the ropes real quick.
    - To get new cows, click the "New Cow" button. This will add a regular old grazing
      cow to our herd!
    - Next you're going to want to use one of our patented potions to upgrade them
      and get them ready for milking.
    - Click the "Upgrade" button and select the cow you want to upgrade, then select
      the potion to give them!
    - Potion supplies are limited, but you can get more by working the farm.
    - Now for ma favorite activity. Milking!
    - Click the "Milking" button, then click the cow you want to milk.
    - You can only milk upgraded cows, and each time you milk them they get bigger
      and stronger!
    - All of these activities cost 'Energy', so keep that in mind as you build up
      your herd for battle.
    - Click the "Play" button once you think you're ready to head into the field.
    - Cows can only be put into the field if there's enough 'Grass'. Be sure to put
      down Grazing Cows to build up the amount of grass the field has!
    - And I think that's it. Oh wait! I almost forgot the most important thing!
    - Welcome to the Milky Way Ranch!
