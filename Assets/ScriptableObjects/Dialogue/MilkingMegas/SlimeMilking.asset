    sentences:
    - (The trick with milking Slime Cows is to get them when they are sleeping)
    - (Which isn't difficult, since they sleep 23 hours out of the day)
    - (However there's always the risk they try to pull you into themselves)
    - (You approach the sleeping Slime Cow, who seems to be using one of her breasts
      as a pillow)
    - (White and sweet smelling liquid drips from her nipples, mixing with her slime
      and the grass.)
    - (You set up a bucket next to her and, slowly so as not to wake her, you begin)
    - (Your hands grow slick with slime as you press and squeeze her breasts)
    - (The Slime Cow barely reacts, and continues snoring as you finish up)
