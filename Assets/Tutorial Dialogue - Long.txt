Rancher> Well howdy! You must be the new guy. Pleasure ta make your acquaintance!
Rancher> To be honest, it's a bit tough finding people who are interested in farming these day.
Rancher> Not entirely sure why, it's good, honest, rewardin' work!
Rancher> Before you start though I've got to ask you a few interview questions.
Rancher> Standard procedure, plus it lets me get to know you a bit better!

Rancher> Let's get started.
Rancher> Which do you think is better: Attack, or Defense?

<Attack> Fire, Metal
<Defense> Water, Earth, Wood

Rancher> Which do you prefer working with: Your Hands, or Tools?

<Hands> Earth, Wood
<Tools> Metal, Water, Fire

Rancher> And finally, do you prefer Cows or Bulls?

Cows> Earth, Fire, Water
Bulls> Metal, Wood

<Combine elements, choose most or random if equal>
{Element}

Rancher> And that's it! With that, you are now officially hired.
Rancher> Welcome to the Milky Way Ranch!
Rancher> Might as well get you acquainted with the place, come on in!

<Load into Ranch>

Rancher> This is the ranch! Here you can keep an eye on our Cowgirls.
Or at least, you would if we had any in at the moment. The ones we sent out to
pasture haven't come back yet.
Rancher>That's a bit strange, it's almost time fer their milking.
Rancher> Guess I can show you how to get more to start us off then.
Rancher> Go ahead and click that {town} over yonder

<Click Buy button to buy a cow>

Rancher> Buying cows takes Energy, which you get back at the beginning of each day.
Rancher> Another task that also takes Energy, and the main reason you were hired.
Rancher> Milking!
Rancher> But maybe I'm getting a little ahead of myself.
Rancher> These Grazing Cows are a little skinny to give us any good milk.
Rancher> To fix that, I can make one of Milky Way's patented Element Potions!

Rancher> Here, use this {Element} potion on the Cowgirl. Click our Apothecary, select the potion, and
feed it to our Cowgirl.

<Feed element potion to cow>

Rancher> Great! Now go ahead and milk her.

Rancher> That's it! Potions not only fill our Cowgirls out a bit and get them ready for milking,
it also toughens them up!
Rancher> We might be needing someone working security with these cows too.
Rancher> Some weirdo's been cutting weird circles in my grazing fields!
Rancher> Speaking of, lets go there next. We can look for my other girls are.

<Begin main gameplay part, single alien appears>

Rancher> Holy Holstaurs! What is that weird looking thing?
Rancher> It's heading towards the farm, we have to stop it!
Rancher> You'll need Grass to bring out our stronger Cowgirls.
Rancher> Place one down, then when you can get our bigger girls out here.

<Place grazing cow, alien starts walking. Put an element cow in front of it>
<Once the alien is destroyed,exit back to ranch>

Rancher> That thing was creepy, like some sort of evil alien!
Rancher> Guess we know what happened to my Cowgirls.
Rancher> I'll get working on some potions, and leave you to get acquainted with your
daily duties.
Rancher> We're probably going to need our Cowgirls in tip-top shape if those aliens come
back.
Rancher> It's quite a way to start your first day, but I'm glad you've showed up when you did.
Rancher> Once again, welcome to the Milky Way Ranch!
