7. How much should you adhere to the color palette when shading? (like colors? black and whites?)

8. Can you give examples of different color palettes that add different feels to a render? (i.e: warm colors, cold colors or shading, "pop" colors, etc)

9. Are there any common pitfalls or traps someone can fall into when rendering?

10. When/should you use solid black and white in rendering?
