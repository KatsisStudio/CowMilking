## Welcome to The Milky Way Ranch, partner!

We carry nothing but the best Cowgirls, and with our patented Elemental Potions, they produce more milk per cow than any in the region!

Life ain't all milk and cookies though. Weird naked aliens have been attacking our ranch and stealing our cows.

Upgrade your cows, Milk them to grow their strength, and take care of the ornery alien invaders!
